        <p><span>I'm tired of being what you want me to be</span></p>
        <p><span>Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface</span></p>
        <p><span>I don't know what you're expecting of me</span></p>
        <p><span>Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes</span></p>
        <p><span>Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span></p>
        <p><span>Every step that I take is another mistake to you</span></p>
        <p><span>Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there</span></p>
        <p><span>Become so tired, so much more aware</span></p>
        <p><span>By becoming this all I want to do</span></p>
        <p><span>Is be more like me and be less like you</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>Can't you see that you're smothering me?</span></p>
        <p><span>Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control</span></p>
        <p><span>Cause everything that you thought I would be</span></p>
        <p><span>Has fallen apart right in front of you</span></p>
        <p><span>Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span></p>
        <p><span>Every step that I take is another mistake to you</span></p>
        <p><span>Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span></p>
        <p><span>And every second I waste is more than I can take!</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there</span></p>
        <p><span>Become so tired, so much more aware</span></p>
        <p><span>By becoming this all I want to do</span></p>
        <p><span>Is be more like me and be less like you</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>And I know I may end up failing too</span></p>
        <p><span>But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there</span></p>
        <p><span>Become so tired, so much more aware</span></p>
        <p><span>By becoming this all I want to do</span></p>
        <p><span>Is be more like me and be less like you</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there</span></p>
        <p><span>I'm tired of being what you want me to be</span></p>
        <p><span>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there</span></p>
        <p><span>I'm tired of being what you want me to be</span></p>
